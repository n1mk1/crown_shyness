# Crown Shyness  

## Definition  
Crown shyness is a natural phenomenon where the crowns of trees do not touch, forming distinct gaps in the canopy.  

## Occurrence  
This phenomenon is commonly observed among trees of the same species but can also occur between different species.  

## Possible Causes  

### Mechanical Abrasion  
Tree branches may collide in the wind, causing damage that prevents further growth in those areas.  

### Light Competition  
Trees may adjust their growth to maximize light exposure and reduce competition.  

### Pest Prevention  
Gaps in the canopy may help limit the spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.  

## Scientific Study  
Researchers have studied crown shyness since the 1920s, and multiple hypotheses suggest that different species may have evolved this trait independently.
